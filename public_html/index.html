      <p>Hello, Im Breck Ortiz! Im a game developer, TAMU Computer Science Student, and Esports player (Smash Brothers Ultimate). This summer I worked 40 hours a week with <a href="https://www.aspyr.com/">Aspyr Media</a> on the game <a href="https://humankind.game/en">Humankind</a> This was my first time working with a company on
          a game, and I really enjoyed it! I mainly worked on front-end things there, using unity to improve the user interface, gameplay, and experience.
          I plan to go back during the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>I also work on projects of my own, featured below is my new game Chess 2.0 an online multiplayer take on the game of chess. This version of chess allows for parries, reads, abilities, and much more. I have been working on it since September of 2022. Im really excited to release it on IOS and steam.
        I highly recommend watching the video as this summary does not do it justice. The video below is a Chess 2.0 demonstration to about 30 fellow Texas A&M game developers.</p>
      <p>Coming back to the esports player thing, Im a Smash Brothers Ultimate Player for Texas A&M! 
        The team Im on goes to different tournaments and events in and out of state to compete for money, scholarships, and fun!
        My insight into esports and competitive gaming has allowed me to perform better when working on my own game projects. It helps me balance the games better as I am aware of how a competitive player would interact with my games, It also helps me prioritize certain feelings and quality of life attributes of a game that can be played at a top level.</p>
        <p>Another game I made is a local multiplayer fighting game called HitBoxing. I made it in unity as well. 2 to 4 players connect to the game using a controller, and then fight it out smash style, with platforms, wave dashing, and various moves. This project is not polished but can be viewed below as well.
          I am very proud of my work and what Ive done to make all the above happen, and if you have any questions, please reach out to me at breck.ortiz12@gmail.com </p>

          <p>My passion is for game development, and as of the past 4 years, Ive been pursuing it, from making Smash Bros games to making chess 2.0 to working with a game studio, Ive loved it all and I will continue to pursue this path</p>
          <p>In the immediate future, I will be working with Aspyr and finishing a passion project of mine, Chess 2.0, both of which will use my skills in unity and general programming</p>
          <p>Esports is a hobby of mine that helps me in creating games. The team I play on travels in and out of state to compete. Knowing how a competitive player views games really helps in my game developer journey</p>

        <p>In my high school days, I did a lot of work with <a href="https://mlf.org/">Mobile Loaves & Fishes</a>. They are an organization dedicated to helping the homeless community in Austin, Texas.</p>
        <p>Most of the work I did with them involved making homes for those in need, which would then be given to homeless people as they got back on their feet, dropped drugs, and found a job. This work was very fulfilling, and I would love to do more when I have the chance to.</p>
